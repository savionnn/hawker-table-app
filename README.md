# Hawker Table Occupancy App

A QR-based web application that allows users to check and manage table availability at a hawker centre.

Users can scan a QR code at a table to mark it as **occupied**, and scan another QR code at tray return points or exits to mark the table as **available** again. Other users can view the app to see current table availability and overall capacity.
